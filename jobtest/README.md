Section A: General Knowledge (Applicable to both frontend and backend developers).

1. What are the key security considerations when developing financial applications?
   When developing financial applications, security is crucial to protect sensitive data. Key considerations include using encryption to secure user information, implementing strong login protections like two-factor authentication or biometrics, and ensuring users only have access to the data relevant to them. It's important to secure communication channels to prevent interception, comply with privacy laws to keep personal and financial data confidential, and set up fraud detection systems to monitor for unusual activity. Regularly testing for vulnerabilities, writing secure code, and staying vigilant against potential threats are all necessary to keep the app safe and trustworthy for users.

2. Describe the importance of compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and GDPR in financial applications.
   Compliance standards like PCI-DSS and GDPR are like rules and safety measures to protect sensitive information of users when they use financial apps.
   PCI-DSS makes sure users credit card details are safely stored, so it doesnt get into the wrong hands, while GDPR ensures their personal details are kept private and only used the way the user agreed for them to be used.
   They are important because they protect sensitive data, ensure legal compliance, and build trust between financial institutions and their customers.

3. Explain the concept of "idempotency" in financial transactions and why it's crucial.
   In simple terms, idempotency in financial transactions means that no matter how many times you try to do the same thing, the result will always be the same. For example, if you send money to someone, even if you accidentally click the button twice, the system will make sure the transaction only happens once, so you don’t end up sending the same payment twice.
   This is really important in financial transactions because we don’t want customers to accidentally pay more than once for the same thing. It helps prevent mistakes like double charges or duplicated payments, keeping the system safe and trustworthy.

4. What are the potential risks of handling sensitive customer data, and how can they be mitigated?
   Handling sensitive customer data comes with several risks, including but not limited to the potential for data breaches, where hackers steal personal or financial information.
   There’s also the risk of data misuse, like if an employee accesses customer information without proper permission.
   Human error, such as accidentally sending data to the wrong person or not protecting it properly, can also lead to problems.
   To reduce these risks, businesses can encrypt sensitive data so it’s unreadable without the right key, use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to secure accounts, and make sure only authorized people can access the data.
   Regularly training employees, conducting security audits, and following strict privacy laws can also help prevent mishaps and keep customer data safe.

Theoretical Questions

1. How would you ensure the UI/UX of a banking web application is both user-friendly and secure?
   To make sure a banking web application is both easy to use and secure, the design needs to be simple and straightforward with clear menus, buttons, and labels that make it easy for users to do understand and do what they need on the app.
   Important actions should have clear warnings and steps to confirm before anything happens, so users don’t make mistakes.

2. Explain the role of form validation and data masking in financial applications.
   In financial applications, form validation and data masking play important roles in keeping things secure and user-friendly.
   Form validation ensures that users enter the correct information when filling out forms. For example, it checks that an email address is properly formatted, or that a credit card number is valid while Data masking, on the other hand, hides sensitive information, like credit card numbers or account details, from unauthorized users. For example, it might show only the last four digits of a credit card number, while masking the rest.

3. Discuss strategies for handling real-time data updates (e.g., account balance changes) in a React application.
   Handling real-time data updates in a React application can be achieved through various strategies, with WebSockets being one of the most effective approaches. A popular library like Socket.IO simplifies the use of WebSockets by managing connection handling, automatic reconnections, and fallbacks to polling when necessary. This ensures continuous, bidirectional communication between the client and the server.

   Socket.IO can be used to push data, such as account balance changes, in real-time to the client. When a balance change occurs on the server, the client can instantly receive the updated data without making repeated requests. This results in a more responsive and dynamic user experience.

   Other strategies for handling real-time updates include:

   a. Polling: Periodically fetching data from the server at a fixed interval. While simpler, it introduces some delay and can increase server load.
   b. Server-Sent Events (SSE): A lightweight, unidirectional communication method where the server sends data updates to the client over a persistent HTTP connection.
   By combining WebSockets (or Socket.IO), polling, or SSE, you can ensure that your React application provides up-to-date information, such as account balance changes, without unnecessary delays.

4. What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and how can they benefit a financial institution?
   A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that behaves like a native app but is accessed through a browser. It combines the best parts of websites and mobile apps, offering features like offline access, fast loading, and the ability to be installed on a user’s home screen without going through an app store.
